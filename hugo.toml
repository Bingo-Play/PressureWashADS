    review = 'Contacted ADS Wash and Seal to do my a major job on interlocking brick for driveway, patio, walks and pool surround. On site visit to provide an estimate which was appropriate and competitive with other companies. Choose ADS based on their responsiveness to e mail. The team led by BJ did an excellent job resetting pavers, adjusting drain spots and replacing cracked stones as needed. Power washing, sanding and sealing followed. The whole job took about 2 weeks but was delayed by weather issues. Extremely pleased with the final result and the attention given to the final product. Excellent customer service and very responsive to ensure customer satisfaction. I will book this company to do work in the future and would highly recommend them.'
